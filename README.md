# Connect Four

A version of connect four made while on the School of Code course with my team member Bradley.
Original version made in week 4 of our bootcamp.
All changes come after the bootcamp.

## How to play
### Current version only playable on local browser and only one person can control.
- Run live version of html/open in browser.
- Enter name of player one and then player two.
- On your turn use the buttons to choose which column you'd like to drop a chip in.

## Change log

- Added in visual display so that colour of chosen slot changes on the page as well as in game array.
- Added a text display that shows current player and there colour.
- Added a variety of console logs to show and explain what is happening as game proceeds. Access your development console and then navigate to console to see these.
- Changed CSS to centre the display.
